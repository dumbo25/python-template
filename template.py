# This style of commenting is called a garden bed and it is frowned upon by
# those who know python. But, I like it. I use a garden bed at the top to track
# my to do list as I work on the code, and then mark the completed To Dos. 
#
# Within the code, To Dos include a comment with ???, which makes it easy for 
# me to find
#
# Once the To Do list is more-or-less complete, I move the completed items into
# comments, docstrings or help within the code. Next, I remove the completed
# items.
